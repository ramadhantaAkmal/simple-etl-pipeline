# Simple ETL Pipeline Project

## Overview

This project is to demonstrate ETL pipelining using only python and pandas. The datasets, sourced from Kaggle, consist of multiple CSV files that are cleaned, transformed, and merged into a single CSV file using Python and the pandas library. The resulting dataset is structured and ready for further analysis.

## Technology Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Shell Script**

## Feature
- **Multiple Data Extraction**
- **Data Transformation from wide to long format**
- **Dynamic Configuration of path and data sources**
- **Scalable merge algorithm**
- **System Process Logger**

## Task Description

This project demonstrates the creation of an ETL pipeline to process multiple CSV datasets from Kaggle. Using Python and pandas, the data is cleaned, transformed, and consolidated into a single analysis-ready CSV file. All of the program process will be recorded into log files. The exercise was conducted as part of the Purwadhika School Data Engineering curriculum.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Download your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
- Place the `kaggle.json` file in the appropriate directory:
  - **Linux/macOS**: `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
  - **Windows**: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`
- Ensure the `EXTRACT_PATH` and `LOAD_PATH` variables are configured in `settings.py` located in the `config` directory.

### Recommended Environment
- **Linux** or **macOS** is recommended for running the program.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramadhantaAkmal/etl-pipeline-capstone-project.git
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure directory path:**
   - Edit `config/setting.py` on where you want to store the file

### Running the Program
- **Linux/macOS**:
  1. Navigate to the project directory.
  2. Run the shell script:
     ```bash
     ./run-etl-script.sh
     ```
- **Windows**:
  1. Navigate to the project directory.
  2. Run the main Python script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies (Python, pandas, and others listed in the project) are installed.
- The data transformation process is documented in the linked Jupyter Notebook.
